# Compiler-Design

This project is a three-part compiler frontend for the sD language, developed over the Spring 2025 semester. The frontend includes:

### 1. Lexical Analysis (Scanner)
Implemented using **Lex (flex)**, this component scans source code written in the sD language and tokenizes it into meaningful lexical elements such as identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.

Run the following commands on Cygwin64 or terminal:

```bash
flex scanner.l         # generate lex.yy.c
gcc lex.yy.c -lfl -o scanner  # use GCC compile scanner
./scanner < HelloWorld.sd   # print on terminal 
```

If you want to save the result to text file, run: 

```bash
./scanner < HelloWorld.sd > result.txt  # save output as result
```

### 2. Syntax Analysis (Parser)
Built using **Yacc (or Bison)**, the parser takes the token stream from the scanner and constructs a parse tree according to the sD language grammar rules.

### 3. Code Generation (Java Bytecode)
This stage takes the parse tree and generates equivalent **Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode** that can be executed on a JVM.

## Tools Used
- Flex Lexical analyzer generator
- Yacc / Bison (Parser generator)
- C/C++ (for compiling and integrating generated code)
- Java Virtual Machine (for executing generated bytecode)

## Language: sD
The sD language is a simplified educational programming language. Its lexical, syntactic, and semantic rules are designed for learning compiler design concepts.
